"Automating Inventory and Quality Reporting using RPA in a Manufacturing Plant"


---

📘 Overview:

This project demonstrates how Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can improve efficiency in a manufacturing setup by automating repetitive tasks such as inventory tracking, quality control reporting, and purchase order creation.


---

🎯 Objectives:

Automate Excel-based inventory updates

Extract machine performance data and generate daily reports

Send alerts for low stock and quality issues

Create purchase order drafts based on predefined thresholds



---

⚙️ Tools & Technologies:

RPA Tool: UiPath / Power Automate / Automation Anywhere (choose one)

Programming: Python (for data preprocessing or calculations)

Data Source: Excel / CSV / simulated ERP data

Notification: Email automation (Outlook or Gmail)

✅ Key Automation Workflows:

1. Inventory Management Bot:

Reads inventory data from Excel

Checks stock against reorder thresholds

Creates a draft purchase order (PDF or Excel)

Sends alert email if stock is low


2. Quality Report Bot:

Reads machine logs (CSV)

Identifies faulty patterns or error codes

Generates a daily quality report (Excel/PDF)

Emails it to the QA department

📈 Impact & Benefits:

Reduced manual data entry by 90%

Improved speed and accuracy in reporting

Real-time alerts to prevent downtime

Saves 2–3 man-hours per day per line
